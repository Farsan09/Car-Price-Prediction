# Car-Price-Prediction

Built a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on multiple features.

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between car features and prices.

Split data into training and testing sets for reliable model evaluation.

Trained and optimized the linear regression model to improve prediction accuracy.

Evaluated performance using RÂ² score, MAE, and RMSE metrics.

Created visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to interpret results and feature importance.

Provided insights into the most influential factors affecting car price fluctuations.
