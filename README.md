# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict **car prices** based on multiple vehicle features.  
The goal is to analyze relationships between features and prices, evaluate model performance, and provide **insights into the most influential factors** affecting price fluctuations.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build a **Linear Regression model** to predict car prices.  
- Perform **EDA** to identify trends and feature relationships.  
- Evaluate model accuracy with statistical metrics.  
- Provide actionable insights into pricing strategies.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values.  
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, transmission).  
- Standardized features for better regression performance.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Investigated relationships between car features and price.  
- Correlation heatmaps to find strongest predictors.  
- Visualized distributions of key attributes (mileage, horsepower, year, etc.).  

### 3. Model Development  
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression model**.  
- Fine-tuned model for improved prediction accuracy.  

### 4. Model Evaluation  
- **R² Score** – variance explained by the model.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – average error.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – penalized large errors.  

### 5. Visualization  
- Regression plots to compare predictions vs actual prices.  
- Feature importance visualizations.  
- Distribution plots for model residuals.

## ✅ Results & Insights  
- The model achieved a **good R² score**, explaining a significant portion of price variation.  
- **Most influential features:** car age, mileage, engine size, and fuel type.  
- Observed **negative correlation** between mileage and price.  
- Insights suggest buyers value **newer cars, fuel efficiency, and larger engines**.  

📌 **Business Impact:** These findings can guide **pricing strategies, dealership valuations, and marketing campaigns**.
